Leave networking in analysis,
go through the monte carlo in more depth in the prototype,
go through the prototype in more detail.

Respond to feedback with Analysis.

Leave out networking bits still, still do
rest.

Wants to check the code after the summer,
then if its good enough, I can take out the
networking bits.

But project is complex enough with just AI.

Project is open-ended, can make changes until final submission.
can make code changes after summer?
what if code not good enough?
any tests/ chances to increase predicted grades after summer?
